# Shen for JavaScript

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rkoeninger/ShenScript/master/assets/logo.png" align="right">

An implementation of the [Shen Language](http://www.shenlanguage.org) by [Mark Tarver](http://marktarver.com/) for JavaScript. Full documentation can be viewed at [shenscript.readthedocs.io](https://shenscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Features

  * Allows integration with arbitrary I/O.
  * Async operations are transparent to written Shen code.
  * Easy interop: JS can be called from Shen, Shen can be called from JS.
  * Fairly small production webpack bundle (\~370KB uncompressed, \~60KB gzip compressed).
  * Decent web startup time (\~50ms in Chromium, \~100ms in Firefox).

## Prerequisites

Requires recent version (10+) of [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Works in most modern browers (Chromium, Firefox, Safari and Edge).

## Building and Testing

First, run `npm install` as you would with any other Node project. Then run the following scripts build and test the project. Steps need to be run in order - steps after `fetch-kernel` won't work if the kernel hasn't been fetched.

| Script          | Description                                                                                                       |
|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `test-backend`  | Runs `mocha` tests for the basic environment and compiler.                                                        |
| `fetch-kernel`  | Downloads the kernel sources from [shen-sources](https://github.com/Shen-Language/shen-sources.git) to `kernel/`. |
| `render-kernel` | Translates the kernel sources to JavaScript and stores under `kernel/js/`.                                        |
| `test-kernel`   | Runs the test suite that comes with the Shen kernel.                                                              |
| `test-frontend` | Runs `mocha` tests for helper and interop functions.                                                              |
| `bundle-dev`    | Applies babel transforms and webpack's into web-deployable bundle.                                                |
| `bundle`        | Builds bundle in production mode.                                                                                 |
| `bundle-min`    | Builds minified production bundle.                                                                                |
| `bundles`       | Generates all bundles.                                                                                            |
| `lint`          | If you make changes, run `lint` to check adherence to style and code quality.                                     |

## Running

### Demo Page

Run `npm start` to start webpack watch or `npm run bundle-dev` to do a one-time build.

If you open `index.html` in your browser a basic webpage will load, and when ready, it will display the load time. (The production webpack bundle does not automatically create a Shen environment and does not log anything.) `index.html` should be viewable without hosting in a web server, but you will not be able to use the `load` function to load additional Shen code if opened from a relative `file://` path. `http-server` is adequate for hosting in a web server.

If you open the JavaScript console in the developer tools, it is possible to access to the `$` global object and execute commands:

```javascript
$.exec("(+ 1 1)").then(console.log);
```

Chaining the `then` call is necessary because `exec` will return a `Promise`. For more information refer to the [documentation](https://shenscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interop.html).

### REPL

Run `npm run repl` to run a command-line REPL. It should have the same behavior as the `shen-cl` REPL. `node.` functions will be available. Run `(node.exit)` to exit the REPL.

Neither command-line options nor the `launcher` kernel extension are implemented. ShenScript is not intended to take the form of a standalone executable.
